## The beginning
*27.11.2021*

What is the best point to start a new project with? In our case, sign-in/sign-up functionality in the web client and some basic authentication code in the server. We intend to stick to best known practices and use proven and widely accepted libraries and components.

So, for the beginning, our stack looks like the following. For the server: nodejs + express + passport (with simplest local storage strategy). For the client: react + mui + redux toolkit + rtk-query.

Letâ€™s see how it will go, mainly how the rtk-query will mix in as I have never used it before.
